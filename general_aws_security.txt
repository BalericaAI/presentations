Manage and support a large pool of rotating AWS accounts, including provisioning, leasing, access controls, automation workflows, and account lifecycle management.--->  you need to use TF for this.
  Sample: https://github.com/BalericaAI/presentations/blob/main/terraform/aws_iam.tf

Maintain and enhance the automation systems responsible for opening, monitoring, and cleaning accounts after lease expiration.

Step 1 — Get the account password policy

    aws iam get-account-password-policy \
      --query 'PasswordPolicy.MaxPasswordAge' \
      --output text

Step 2 — Count users whose passwords are expired

    aws iam list-users \
      --query "Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '90 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`].UserName" \
      --output text | wc -w

What this does
    Filters only users with console passwords
    Compares PasswordLastUsed against the expiration window
    Outputs a count, not a list (good for reporting)

2) IAM users whose last login was more than 30 days ago

    aws iam list-users \
      --query "Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`].[UserName,PasswordLastUsed]" \
      --output table


Example output

-----------------------------------------
|              ListUsers                |
+----------------+----------------------+
|  UserName      |  PasswordLastUsed    |
+----------------+----------------------+
|  legacy.user   |  2023-11-02T14:18Z   |
|  contractor01  |  2023-10-15T09:41Z   |
+----------------+----------------------+


If you want just the count

    aws iam list-users \
      --query "length(Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`])" \
      --output text


Optional: One-line combined audit snapshot

If you want a clean demo moment:

    echo "Expired passwords:" && \
    aws iam list-users \
      --query "length(Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '90 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`])" \
      --output text && \
    echo "Inactive >30 days:" && \
    aws iam list-users \
      --query "length(Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`])" \
      --output text

Inactive Account Detection (Last Login > 30 Days)
What the student did (technical):
    Queried IAM user PasswordLastUsed timestamps
    Identified dormant console users exceeding inactivity threshold
    Generated counts and tabular reports
Resume bullet (polished):

    • Identified dormant IAM console accounts by analyzing authentication timestamps to 
      support least-privilege enforcement and access reviews.

Combined “Architect-Level” Resume Bullet
This is gold for Cloud IAM / Security Architect roles:

    • Automated IAM access hygiene checks aligned to NIST and CIS controls by identifying 
      expired credentials and dormant accounts using AWS CLI, supporting least-privilege 
      enforcement and audit readiness.

Optional: “Lab / Project” Section Template
You can reuse this verbatim:

    IAM Compliance Automation Lab (AWS)
      • Implemented CLI-based IAM access hygiene checks aligned to NIST SP 800-53 and CIS 
        Critical Security Controls.
      • Identified expired credentials and dormant accounts using authentication metadata.
      • Produced audit-ready metrics suitable for security reviews and SIEM ingestion.


Develop Terraform modules, infrastructure code, and reusable templates that product teams can leverage when deploying into these innovation environments.
Integrate private AWS accounts (behind firewalls) with Cloudflare or similar technologies to support external-facing demo or customer environments.
Build and maintain CI/CD pipelines—primarily GitHub Actions—to support secure deployments and account configuration workflows.
Collaborate directly with product, engineering, and data science teams to understand their demo and experimentation needs.
Implement and maintain IAM solutions, including SAML/IDC integrations and identity governance for multi-account access.
Contribute to day-to-day operations of the innovation accounts, including automation improvements, troubleshooting, and building developer‑friendly tooling.
Participate in daily standups, sprint ceremonies, and agile workflows alongside an engaged engineering and data science organization.
Work closely with a senior engineer who developed the platform to expand, optimize, and scale the system.
 

Required Skills:

5+ years of hands-on AWS engineering experience, supporting multiple AWS accounts (not a single-product sysadmin background).
Strong proficiency in AWS IAM, including SAML, identity federation, and enterprise access patterns.
Experience managing infrastructure-as-code via Terraform.
Expertise with CI/CD pipelines, especially GitHub Actions, and understanding of how deployment workflows apply to multi-account AWS environments.
Ability to integrate secure AWS workloads with external services (e.g., Cloudflare) and build safe connectivity patterns.
Comfortable working with private, internal-only AWS environments behind firewalls.
Strong communication skills and willingness to work directly with internal customers (primarily data science teams and product engineering groups).
Familiar with agile processes: daily standups, sprint cycles, Slack collaboration, and cross-team support.
Not a heads-down coder—must be collaborative, customer-focused, and able to explain technical decisions clearly.
