Manage and support a large pool of rotating AWS accounts, including provisioning, leasing, access controls, automation workflows, and account lifecycle management.--->  you need to use TF for this.
  Sample: https://github.com/BalericaAI/presentations/blob/main/terraform/aws_iam.tf

Maintain and enhance the automation systems responsible for opening, monitoring, and cleaning accounts after lease expiration.

Step 1 — Get the account password policy

    aws iam get-account-password-policy \
      --query 'PasswordPolicy.MaxPasswordAge' \
      --output text

Step 2 — Count users whose passwords are expired

    aws iam list-users \
      --query "Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '90 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`].UserName" \
      --output text | wc -w

What this does
    Filters only users with console passwords
    Compares PasswordLastUsed against the expiration window
    Outputs a count, not a list (good for reporting)

2) IAM users whose last login was more than 30 days ago

    aws iam list-users \
      --query "Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`].[UserName,PasswordLastUsed]" \
      --output table


Example output

-----------------------------------------
|              ListUsers                |
+----------------+----------------------+
|  UserName      |  PasswordLastUsed    |
+----------------+----------------------+
|  legacy.user   |  2023-11-02T14:18Z   |
|  contractor01  |  2023-10-15T09:41Z   |
+----------------+----------------------+


If you want just the count

    aws iam list-users \
      --query "length(Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`])" \
      --output text


Optional: One-line combined audit snapshot

If you want a clean demo moment:

    echo "Expired passwords:" && \
    aws iam list-users \
      --query "length(Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '90 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`])" \
      --output text && \
    echo "Inactive >30 days:" && \
    aws iam list-users \
      --query "length(Users[?PasswordLastUsed!=null && PasswordLastUsed<=\`$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\`])" \
      --output text

Inactive Account Detection (Last Login > 30 Days)
What the student did (technical):
    Queried IAM user PasswordLastUsed timestamps
    Identified dormant console users exceeding inactivity threshold
    Generated counts and tabular reports
Resume bullet (polished):

    • Identified dormant IAM console accounts by analyzing authentication timestamps to 
      support least-privilege enforcement and access reviews.

Combined “Architect-Level” Resume Bullet
This is gold for Cloud IAM / Security Architect roles:

    • Automated IAM access hygiene checks aligned to NIST and CIS controls by identifying 
      expired credentials and dormant accounts using AWS CLI, supporting least-privilege 
      enforcement and audit readiness.

Optional: “Lab / Project” Section Template
You can reuse this verbatim:

    IAM Compliance Automation Lab (AWS)
      • Implemented CLI-based IAM access hygiene checks aligned to NIST SP 800-53 and CIS 
        Critical Security Controls.
      • Identified expired credentials and dormant accounts using authentication metadata.
      • Produced audit-ready metrics suitable for security reviews and SIEM ingestion.


Develop Terraform modules, infrastructure code, and reusable templates that product teams can leverage when deploying into these innovation environments.---> you know this already.

Integrate private AWS accounts (behind firewalls) with Cloudflare or similar technologies to support external-facing demo or customer environments.---> This is organizations, easy.

Build and maintain CI/CD pipelines—primarily GitHub Actions—to support secure deployments and account configuration workflows.---> You know this.

Collaborate directly with product, engineering, and data science teams to understand their demo and experimentation needs.

1) What “Collaboration” Actually Means in Hiring Language
When a job description says:
    Collaborate directly with product, engineering, and data science teams…

They mean the student can:
    Ask the right questions
    Translate non-security needs into technical requirements
    Modify infrastructure, data access, or logging without blocking teams
    Leave clear artifacts others can use

2) The Collaboration Triangle
| Team         | What They Actually Care About         | What the Student Must Translate              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Product      | Demos, timelines, customer visibility | Temporary access, environments, auditability |
| Engineering  | Velocity, stability                   | IAM scopes, automation, guardrails           |
| Data Science | Data access, experimentation          | Least-privilege access, cost, logging        |

3) What Students Should Produce
A) A Written Requirement Summary (even informal)
Students should show a 1–2 paragraph summary like:

• Product required temporary demo access to a cloud environment without persistent credentials.
• Engineering required repeatable environment setup for short-lived testing.
• Data science required read-only access to curated datasets for experimentation.

B) A Technical Translation (This Is the Real Skill)
Example mapping:
| Need            | Technical Action              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Demo access     | Time-bound IAM roles          |
| Experimentation | Read-only dataset permissions |
| Fast iteration  | Terraform modules             |
| Safety          | Logging + audit trails        |

Students should explicitly show this translation.

4) Resume Language (Use This Verbatim)
Entry-Level / Early Caree

• Worked with product, engineering, and data science stakeholders to translate demo 
  and experimentation requirements into secure cloud access and automation workflows.

Mid-Level
• Collaborated cross-functionally with product, engineering, and data science teams 
  to design IAM access patterns and environments supporting demos and experimentation 
  while maintaining security controls.

Architect / Senior
• Partnered with product, engineering, and data science teams to enable demos and 
  experimentation through secure, automated cloud access models and observability.

5) What to Say in Interviews 
Students should be able to answer:
  “How did you collaborate?”

With something like:
    “I met with product to understand demo timelines, engineering to understand environment constraints, and data science to understand data access needs. I translated     those into time-bound IAM roles, read-only dataset access, and automated provisioning so teams could move fast without creating long-lived risk.”

This is a complete answer. No jargon overload.
    • Enabled cross-team demos and experimentation by collaborating with product, 
      engineering, and data science stakeholders and implementing secure, automated 
      cloud access patterns.


Implement and maintain IAM solutions, including SAML/IDC integrations and identity governance for multi-account access.---> Honestly, you need Azure for this.

Contribute to day-to-day operations of the innovation accounts, including automation improvements, troubleshooting, and building developer‑friendly tooling.

What “Developer-Friendly Tooling” Actually Means
Developers want to:
    Move fast
    Not think about IAM, logging, or compliance
    Not open tickets for trivial things
    Not accidentally break security

Security / Cloud teams want:
    Guardrails
    Auditability
    Least privilege
    Repeatability

Developer-friendly tooling is the bridge.

The 5 Core Traits of Developer-Friendly Tooling
1) Self-Service
Developers can do common tasks without filing tickets.
  Examples:
    Request temporary access via a script
    Spin up a sandbox environment with one command
    Rotate credentials automatically

2) Opinionated (But Not Blocking)
The tool nudges developers into the right path by default.
  Examples:
    Terraform modules with secure defaults
    Predefined IAM roles instead of custom policies
    Guardrails that fail fast with clear messages

3) Fast Feedback
When something fails, developers immediately know why.
  Examples:
    Clear error messages
    Pre-flight validation scripts
    “You’re missing permission X” instead of AccessDenied

4) Minimal Cognitive Load
Developers shouldn’t need to understand cloud internals.
  Examples:
    ./create-demo-env.sh
    make sandbox
    terraform apply with no extra flags

5) Documented at the Point of Use
Docs live next to the tool, not in Confluence.
  Examples:
    README in repo
    --help output
    Inline comments

Concrete Examples (What They Really Mean)

IAM / Access Tooling
    Not developer-friendly:
        “Submit an access request ticket”
        “Wait 3 days”
    
    Developer-friendly:
        Script or CLI that grants time-bound role access
        Auto-expires permissions
        Logs everything
    
    Resume phrasing:
        • Built self-service IAM tooling allowing developers to request temporary access 
          for demos and experimentation while enforcing least-privilege controls.

Environment Provisioning
    Not developer-friendly:
        Manual setup steps
        Tribal knowledge
        Copy/paste Terraform
    Developer-friendly:
        Reusable Terraform modules
        One-command environment spin-up
        Automatic tagging and logging
    
    Resume phrasing:
        • Created developer-friendly Terraform modules to provision sandbox and demo 
          environments with secure defaults and built-in observability.

Innovation Accounts (Important Context)
    “Innovation accounts” usually mean:
        Sandboxes
        Labs
        PoCs
        Demo environments
        Experimental data science work
    So developer-friendly tooling here means:
        Safe to break
        Easy to rebuild
        Cheap
        Logged
        Disposable
    
    What Students Should Say in Interviews
        “Developer-friendly tooling means removing friction for engineers by providing self-service, opinionated tools with secure defaults—so teams can demo
          and experiment quickly without bypassing security.”

What Not to Say ❌
    Avoid:
        “I made scripts developers liked”
        “I helped developers”
        “I improved usability”
    
    Those are vague and weak.
