Mock Panel Questions
What Enterprise-Style Interviewers Will Ask
Presentation-Driven Questions
    “Which of these incidents is most common in your experience?”
    “Where would you prioritize fixing this first?”
    “What would you automate vs keep manual?”
    “How would you explain this to an executive?”
    “What tradeoffs do you see?”

Technical Follow-Ups (AWS / Kubernetes)
    “How would you prevent IAM permission creep?”
    “How do you verify OPA enforcement before deployment?”
    “What’s the difference between guardrails and detection?”
    “How would you scope access in a multi-account AWS setup?”
    “What’s your approach to least privilege in Kubernetes?”

Consulting / Customer Questions
    “What if the customer disagrees?”
    “What if security slows the team down?”
    “Who owns rollback?”
    “How do you balance speed and safety?”
    “How do you handle incomplete information?”


Hostile / Stress-Test Follow-Ups
How to Stay Calm When the Room Pushes Back

Note to Students:
These are deliberately uncomfortable.
The goal is composure, not perfection.

Hostile Question 1
    “Isn’t this just a process failure?”

Good answer:
    “Process is part of it, but systems that rely on perfect process usually fail. I focus on controls that reduce the cost of human error.”

Hostile Question 2
    “Why didn’t they just test it?”

Good answer:
    “They tested the happy path. What was missing was a test that verified enforcement across all scopes.”

Hostile Question 3
    “Sounds like they shouldn’t have had access.”

Good answer:
    “Access was necessary for the task. The issue was not bounding it tightly enough or verifying removal.”

Hostile Question 4
    “Isn’t OPA supposed to prevent this?”

Good answer:
    “OPA prevents what it’s enforcing. The failure was assuming enforcement without verifying scope and mode.”

Hostile Question 5
    “What would you have done differently?”

Best structure:
    Clarify assumptions
    State constraint
    Propose one concrete change

Example:
    “Given the time pressure, I’d add a pre-deploy check that fails if policies aren’t enforced cluster-wide.”

Hostile Question 6
    “How do you avoid slowing teams down?”

Strong answer:
    “By shifting friction earlier. Slow deployments are cheaper than fast incidents.”

Remember this when you feel attacked
    “Panels aren’t testing whether you’re right.
    They’re testing whether you stay thoughtful when challenged.”
