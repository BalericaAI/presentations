How Security Incidents Actually Happen (Human Factors)

(Example Presentation Content)

1️⃣ Opening Frame (First 2–3 Minutes)

Core thesis (say this early):

“Most security incidents don’t happen because people don’t know what to do.
They happen because humans make reasonable decisions under pressure — and systems don’t forgive those decisions.”

This immediately:
  removes blame
  reframes security as a systems problem
  signals consulting maturity
